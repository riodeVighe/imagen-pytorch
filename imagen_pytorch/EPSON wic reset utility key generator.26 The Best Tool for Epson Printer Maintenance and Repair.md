Also, WIC Reset Utility may not support all models of Epson printers. You can check the compatibility list on [https://www.wic.support/supported-models/](https://www.wic.support/supported-models/). If your printer model is not supported, you may need to use another tool such as Epson Adjustment Program or Epson Service Tool.
 
In conclusion, WIC Reset Utility is a handy tool that can help you reset your Epson printer's waste ink counters and perform other maintenance tasks. However, you should also take care of your printer's hardware and use the appropriate tool for your printer model.
