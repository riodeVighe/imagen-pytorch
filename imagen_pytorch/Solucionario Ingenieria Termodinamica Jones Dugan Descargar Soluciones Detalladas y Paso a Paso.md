Engineering Thermodynamics by Jones and Dugan is a classic textbook that covers the fundamentals and applications of thermodynamics in various engineering fields. The book is divided into four parts: Basic Concepts, Thermodynamic Properties, Energy Analysis, and Entropy Analysis. Each part contains several chapters that explain the concepts, laws, equations, and examples of thermodynamics in a clear and rigorous way.
 
The book also includes many exercises and problems that test the reader's understanding and problem-solving skills. The problems range from simple calculations to complex design and optimization tasks. Some of the problems require the use of computer software, such as EES (Engineering Equation Solver), which is included with the book. The software allows the reader to perform numerical analysis, graphical representation, and parametric studies of thermodynamic systems.
 
Engineering Thermodynamics by Jones and Dugan is a comprehensive and authoritative reference for students and professionals who want to learn more about thermodynamics and its applications in engineering. The book covers both classical and modern topics, such as refrigeration, heat pumps, power cycles, combustion, fuel cells, and renewable energy. The book also provides historical notes, biographical sketches, and practical tips that enrich the reader's knowledge and appreciation of thermodynamics.
