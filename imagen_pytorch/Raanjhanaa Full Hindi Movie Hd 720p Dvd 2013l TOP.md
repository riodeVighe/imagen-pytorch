One of the major controversies of the film was its depiction of inter-faith relationships and communal violence. The film showed Zoya hiding her relationship with Akram, a Sikh boy, from her Muslim family and community. It also showed Kundan instigating a mob to attack Akram's political rally, leading to his death. The film also showed Zoya joining a political party that was allegedly based on the Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI), a banned terrorist organization. The film was accused of stereotyping Muslims as orthodox, violent and anti-national. [^1^]
 
Another controversy of the film was its portrayal of stalking and harassment as love. The film showed Kundan pursuing Zoya relentlessly for years, even after she rejected him multiple times. He also threatened to kill himself if she did not agree to marry him. He also manipulated her into marrying him by lying about his health condition. The film was criticized for normalizing and romanticizing such toxic behavior and sending a wrong message to the audience, especially young men. [^2^]
 
The film also faced some legal issues before its release. The Delhi High Court issued a notice to the makers of the film for allegedly hurting the religious sentiments of Hindus by using an objectionable word in one of the songs. The word was later muted in the film. The court also asked the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) to explain how it cleared the film for release. [^3^]
