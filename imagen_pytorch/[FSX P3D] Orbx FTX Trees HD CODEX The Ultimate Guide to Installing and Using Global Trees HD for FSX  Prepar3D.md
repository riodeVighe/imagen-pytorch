However, the default trees in FSX and P3D are not very impressive. They are often too big, too sparse, too uniform, and too aliased. They can also affect your performance and frame rate negatively.
 
That's why Orbx, one of the leading developers of flight simulation addons, created FTX Trees HD. This product is a complete overhaul of your sim's autogen tree textures, replacing them with high-resolution, realistic, and diverse ones that will transform your scenery.
