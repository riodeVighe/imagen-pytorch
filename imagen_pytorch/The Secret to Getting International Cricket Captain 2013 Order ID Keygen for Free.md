If you want to update your game with the latest patch, you need to follow these steps: First, launch the game by double-clicking on the International Cricket Captain 2013 icon on your desktop. When you see the main menu of the game, look for a button that says "Internet Game" and click on it. This will connect you to the official website of the game and download the patch automatically. However, before you can install the patch, you need to make sure that you have admin rights on your computer. To do this, close the game and right-click on the desktop icon again. Then, choose the option "run as administrator" from the menu that appears. This will allow you to install the patch without any problems.
