Family therapy is a form of psychotherapy that involves working with couples and families to improve their relationships, communication, and functioning. Family therapy can help address various issues such as marital conflict, parenting problems, divorce, blended families, substance abuse, domestic violence, mental illness, and more.
  
Family therapy is based on the premise that the family is a system of interconnected and interdependent members who influence each other's behavior and emotions. Family therapists aim to understand the patterns of interaction within the family, identify the strengths and weaknesses of the system, and facilitate positive change by modifying dysfunctional behaviors and enhancing coping skills.

Types of family therapy
  
There are different types of family therapy that vary in their theoretical orientation, goals, techniques, and duration. Some of the common types of family therapy are:

- Family systems therapy: This is an approach that focuses on helping people utilize the strengths of their relationships to overcome mental health problems. It views the family as a system of interconnected and interdependent members who influence each other's behavior and emotions. It aims to identify and modify dysfunctional patterns of interaction within the family.
- Functional family therapy: This is a short-term treatment often utilized for young people experiencing problems with risky behavior, violence, or substance use. It helps teens and families look for solutions while building trust and respect. It also addresses the underlying causes of the problems, such as emotional distress, trauma, or attachment issues.
- Structural family therapy: This is an approach that focuses on the organization and structure of the family. It examines how the family members relate to each other, what roles they play, what boundaries they have, and what rules they follow. It aims to restructure the family system to make it more functional and adaptive.
- Strategic family therapy: This is an approach that focuses on solving specific problems in the family. It involves giving directives or assignments to the family members to change their behavior or communication. It also uses techniques such as reframing, paradoxical interventions, or ordeals to challenge the family's beliefs and expectations.
- Solution-focused family therapy: This is an approach that focuses on finding solutions rather than analyzing problems. It helps the family identify their strengths, resources, and goals. It also uses techniques such as scaling questions, miracle questions, exception questions, or compliments to help the family generate positive changes.
- Narrative family therapy: This is an approach that focuses on helping people rewrite their stories and identities. It views problems as separate from people and influenced by social and cultural factors. It helps the family externalize their problems, deconstruct their dominant narratives, and co-create alternative narratives that reflect their preferred outcomes.
