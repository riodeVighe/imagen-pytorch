iATKOS ML2 is a custom version of Mac OS X 10.8.2 Mountain Lion that can run on any compatible Intel or AMD processor. It is also known as a Hackintosh, which means that you can install Mac OS X on a non-Apple computer. In this article, I will show you how to download and install iATKOS ML2 on your PC using a torrent file.
 
## Step 1: Download the Torrent File
 
The first thing you need to do is to download the torrent file for iATKOS ML2 from the Internet Archive[^2^]. This file contains the image of the installation DVD that you will need to burn or restore to a USB drive. The file size is about 4.7 GB, so it may take some time to download depending on your internet speed.

## Step 2: Burn or Restore the Image File
 
Once you have downloaded the torrent file, you need to use a software like uTorrent or BitTorrent to open it and start downloading the actual image file. After the download is complete, you will have an ISO file named iATKOS\_ML2.iso. You can either burn this file to a dual layer DVD using a software like ImgBurn or Nero, or you can restore it to a USB drive using a software like Disk Utility or TransMac. Make sure you have a blank DVD or a USB drive with at least 8 GB of space.
 
## Step 3: Boot from the DVD or USB Drive
 
Now that you have the installation media ready, you need to boot your PC from it. To do this, you need to change the boot order in your BIOS settings. Usually, you can access the BIOS by pressing a key like F2, F10, F12, or Delete when your PC starts up. Look for an option that lets you choose the boot device and select the DVD or USB drive that contains iATKOS ML2. Save and exit the BIOS and restart your PC.
