## Why Commandos 3 Resolution Problems Occur
 
You may be wondering why Commandos 3 resolution problems occur on Windows 10 and other versions of Windows. The reason is that Commandos 3 is an old game that was released in 2003 and was not designed to run on modern operating systems and hardware. The game uses DirectX 8.1, which is outdated and incompatible with newer versions of DirectX. This causes the game to display wrong colors, flicker, or crash.
 
The crack para commandos 3 resolution fix that we showed you above works by using a program called DXWND, which is a tool that can run old games in windowed mode and apply various fixes and enhancements. By using DXWND, you can force Commandos 3 to run in your native resolution and avoid the resolution problems.
 
## Other Tips and Tricks for Commandos 3
 
Besides the resolution fix, there are some other tips and tricks that can help you improve your Commandos 3 experience. Here are some of them:
 
- If you want to play Commandos 3 in widescreen mode, you can download a widescreen patch from this link: https://sites.google.com/site/xbootx/home/commandos3. This patch contains resolutions from 1024x720 to 1920x1080 for 16:9 aspect ratio and from 1024x600 to 1920x1200 for 16:10 aspect ratio. Follow the instructions on the website to apply the patch.
- If you want to change the language of Commandos 3, you can do so by editing the registry. To do this, open the Run dialog box (Windows key + R) and type "regedit". Navigate to HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\Eidos Interactive\\Commandos3\\1.0 and double-click on "Language". Change the value to your desired language code (for example, "en" for English, "es" for Spanish, etc.). Restart the game and enjoy.
- If you want to use cheats in Commandos 3, you can do so by pressing Shift + X during gameplay. This will open a cheat console where you can type various commands. Some of the commands are:
    - invulnerable: makes your commandos invincible
    - missionwin: completes the current mission
    - missionlose: fails the current mission
    - useresolution: changes the resolution (for example, useresolution 1280 800)
